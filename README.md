Nix home manager setup

## Sections philosophy
hosts has packages that should be found on a particular machine in the future, or the generic hosts "darwin" and "linux" that can be installed on any machine that doesn't need special setup

custompkgs is my packages that I import and use throughout modules

config is global config, but then config can also be stored inside hosts
